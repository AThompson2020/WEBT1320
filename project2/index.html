            <h2>Welcome to Widgets and Things!</h2>
            <p>Widgets and Things is my first ever interactive webpage that I have created for my WEBT 1320 class. This is my second lab project and it has multiple tabs that will take you to an extension of the webpage. I only used a single "witchy" font for the upcoming holiday. Kind of reminded me of the Sanderson sister's book on Hocus Pocus. Sit back and enjoy the site! I even have some overly dramatic popcorn for you down in my images there. Yum Yum, so nummy.</p>

            <p>This is apparently a strange looking cook book. My main image looks similar to a glass of milk growing herbs out of it. I guess someone dropped some chives in their milk to make a creamy onion drink. I don't know but it doesn't sound very appetizing. Well, that's it! Happy "looking at other's webpages". See ya later aligator!</p>
