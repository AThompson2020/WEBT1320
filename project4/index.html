                <h3>Passion meets insanity</h3>
                <p>People mistake infatuation for love. Infatuation wants romance now! Love knows there's romance in the day to day killings. It's easy to let the passion die when you lose that spark for what you love. Share your passions with the one you love and paint the town in red!</p>
