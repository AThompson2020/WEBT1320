                <h3>Husky Needs</h3>
                <p>People often mistake huskies for low maintanence dogs. If regularly cared for, they can be low maintence. They're much like children, some are just more wild than others.  </p>

                <p>The main thing huskies are known for is their big personalities. They are goofballs, lovebugs, filled with chaotic energy, cuddle buddies, very large lap dogs, escape artists, incredibly intellegent, and one of the most stubborn dog breeds you will ever meet. </p>
